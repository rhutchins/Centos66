# Quarter One README.md

## Material for Quarter One

A CentOS 6.6 operating system was the basis for Q1 activities.

The manual configurations from Q1 are reworked into executable configuration
management formats.  These formats are based on the use of Vagrant.

The Shell directory contains a bash shell script provider that is used by
Vagrant to configure the CentOS 6.6 server.

The Ansible directory contains an Ansible yml script provider that is used by
Vagrant to configure the CentOS 6.6 server
